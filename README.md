I have created simple strapping repo for your convenience.

In the master branch its a simple index.html file and css to create a workspace for you that resembles a blueprint.
When you create new block elements they will be outlined which will let you know if some things are out of order.

## new branch gulp

If you need to use gulp in your project you can use the gulp branch that adds gulp to the project.
